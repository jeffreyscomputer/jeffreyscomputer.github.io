      <h1>The Analog Sequence</h1>

      <p>
      The analog electronics sequence at CSULB has been whittled down to three courses: Electric and Electronic Circuits (EE211), Analog Electronic Circuits I (EE330), and Analog Electronic Circuits II (EE430). In years past, I am told, all EEs were required to take a course about semiconductor devices before the first analog electronics course -- basically to obtain a somewhat abstracted quantum mechanical understanding of carrier action inside crystals. Luckily this course was offered as an elective called EE420, so I took it. I also took an additional free course called 6.002x: Circuits &amp Electronics from MIT online through edx.org, and that happened to encompass most of what EE211 and 330 covered at CSULB, with a focus on simple MOSFET circuits (I suspect because the empirical square law model is sufficiently abstract as to reduce questions about carrier action in the device, wheras BJTs seem to raise these questions on their own). I completed all the work for that course aside from the final exam :( which cost me 30% of my otherwise hundo, leaving me with a C minus.
