      <h1>Jeffrey's Schooling</h1>

      <p>
      I recently completed a BS in EE at CSULB, but before I got started with that, I spent a few years pretending I was an artist--and it worked! I was really able to get in touch with my depressed, poetic side with all the sculpture and photography and creative writing courses at the local community college. But once I recognized how much of my spare time was spent making microphones and guitar effects, I decided it was time to get an electrical engineering degree. This page is basically a description of what I learned about electrical engineering while I attended CSULB from books, lectures, and autonomous dicking around.
