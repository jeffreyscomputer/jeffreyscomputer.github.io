      <h1>The second Newman: Christmas Newman</h1>
      <img class="displayed" src="images/ChristmasNewman-full.JPG" />
			<p>I finished this one in time to give it to my brother for the Christmas which followed my senior year of high school. This sucker is at least 2X as gorgeous as the Newman 1, and is made of at least 3X as many materials. I spent darn near close to zero dollars on this one, as it is made out of crap I already had on hand. I gained a modest amount of knowledge from the Newman 1 experience as well as the internet, so I was able to get rid of the buzz in this one by properly shielding the transformer I made. The output is still pretty darn low -- and there were two reasons for that -- three even.</p>
