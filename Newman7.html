      <h1>The seventh Newman: Newman 7</h1>

			<p>I'm actually kind of proud of this one. The output is just about as high as a Royer, the sound is clear (low end is pretty excessive though), noise is pretty low -- and I don't know for sure, but I think it actually looks nice. It's a little rusty now, so I'm glad I didn't sell these. If I were to do it again I'd plate it.</p>

      <p>Here it is sitting in it's fancy case.</p>

      <p>Here's the case -- made from ABS and sheet metal with some foam and automotive headliner upholstery.</p>

      <p>Here's the funny latch I made. It is supposed to look like a 7 and it does.</p>

      <p>All the parts look pretty good.</p>

      <p>Closeup of the transducer. I think I did a nice job on this one.</p>

      <p>I silver-soldered the perforated metal exterior together. It ended up looking pretty seck.</p>
