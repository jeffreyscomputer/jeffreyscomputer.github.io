			<h1>Troubleshooting and Repair of Engine Control Module</h1>
			<p>A friend with a 1993 Mitsubishi Diamante experienced a major problem which caused 4 injectors to remain on all the time, so fuel would just pour out of the exhaust. A mechanic's diagnosis was a computer malfunction, but the exact cause remained unknown. The ECM was sent to several automotive computer specialists, and was judged "unrepairable" by at least one of them. As a last ditch effort to save the car, the engine control module was sent to me.</p>
      <p>The first thing I noticed when I got ahold of the ECM was that several capacitors had been replaced. Aside from that, it didn't look like anything else on the board had been messed with -- and there was quite a lot on the board. I was suprised to see a fairly extensive TTL and discrete transistor section peripheral to the processor and memory, and distinct from the output driving circuits. Long story short, I used a multimeter to test resistances and diode drops to aid in extracting a schematic from the PCB and was able to discover that the problem originated from a damaged 7402 TTL chip.</p>
      <p>The outputs of 7400 series TTL circuits are commonly called "totem pole" output stages, and they look like this:</p>
