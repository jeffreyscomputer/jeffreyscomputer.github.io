			<h1>Jeffrey's Portfolio</h1>

			<h2>Evidence 1</h2>
			<p>
				I went to School at CSULB for an Engineering Degree.
			</p>

			<h2>Evidence 2</h2>
			<p>
				I got good grades (Magna Cum Laude -- not to brag) and THEY gave me an electrical engineering degree (Control and Microelectronics -- not to be too specific).
			</p>

			<h2>Evidence 3</h2>
			<p>
				I did some things that required me to know control theory, solid state devices, network analysis and digital system design.
			</p>

			<h2>Final Argument</h2>
			<p>
				Therefore, I am an engineer who should be hired.
