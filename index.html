			<h3>electrical engineer</h3>
			<p>Jeffrey Cool is a person who was a student of engineering at CSULB until that one day when he graduated Magna Cum Laude with a BS in electrical engineering. Now, he is trying to direct internet traffic to this site, so that people will start thinking about how cool it would be if he had a well paying job. </p>
