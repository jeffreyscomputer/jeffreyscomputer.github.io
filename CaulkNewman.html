      <h1>The third Newman: Caulk Newman</h1>
      <img class="displayed" src="images/CaulkNewman-full.JPG" />
			<p>This is where I thought I was getting pretty sophisticated. This one is from mid 2008 if I remember correctly. I made it just to test out the fancy Lundahl ribbon mic transformer my brother got me for Christmas. Initially after I made the transducer and frame, I noticed it fit well inside a caulking gun, hence the name <i>Caulk Newman</i>. This one is mostly scrap steel, still featuring my signature brazing rod XLR jack, and stuffed with cotton because I read they do that at Royer.</p>
