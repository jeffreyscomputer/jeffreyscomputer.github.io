      <h1>Vibrating String Tuning Control System: The "Unolin"</h1>
      <p>I made this single string instrument as the final project for a digital control laboratory class. The whole course was an exercise in controling the temperature inside a test tube by varying the current through a power resistor using a digital controller based around the BS2 MCU, programmed in PBASIC. Several types of controllers were made - first a nonlinear on/off controller, then a variation with a tolerance band and a bias control signal, proportional control, PI control, PD control, and then a PID controller. </p>
      <p>Since the device I made represented a stable plant with a transfer function well approximated by a simple integrator, I could have made a simple on/off controller and had good results. However, I wanted to see if I could just tune the PID controller I made for the temperature control problem to work with this new plant. And it worked! But it is really slow, and not musical. Enjoy <a href="https://youtu.be/yFc3Zt8blIU" target = "_blank">on youtube</a>.</p>
			<h2>If I Were to Do It Again...</h2>
			<p>I would do it all analog, of course -- and it wouldn't be difficult. </p>
