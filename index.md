My name is Jeffrey Cool, and I happen to be an electrical engineer. I enjoy microelectronics and control above all else, but I will do other things if I must. This website will have some information about what I have been doing for the past several years once I get around to adding that content. The short story is that I have designed electronic things and there is evidence. Goodnight.
