      <h1>My Mircophone Designs</h1>
      <p>These were made years ago -- from about mid 2006 till the end of 2010. I just now got around to taking pictures of them. </p>

			<p>Depicted oldest to newest from left to right: Newman 1 (Poor Newman), Christmas Newman, Caulk Newman, Newman 7. </p>
      <p>There is maybe a lot to explain. First, the name <i>Newman</i> comes from a common mispronunciation of the popular german microphone manufacturer's name: <i>Neuman</i>. An excellent marketing strategy. Second, these are all ribbon microphones, which I'm almost certain Neuman makes none of. Third, there are two designs I did that I don't have shown here -- these are the <i>James Matched Pair Newmans</i> and the <i>Mike's Newman with Protective Foam Cover</i>. I don't have those anymore, as they are the only ones I was able to either sell or trade for sunglasses. Fourth and most importantly, my brother is the one who first told me I should make microphones. Fifth and even more importantly, I have never done any proper recording tests with these -- they have all been used in recordings with varying degrees of success -- the Newman 7 is actually pretty good -- excessive low end though, but this could be because I never did pay much attention to ribbon tention. Keep looking.</p>
