      <h1>Pulse Width Comparator</h1>
      <p>Hypothetical problem: I have a system with multiple PWM controlled actuators, and I desire to have the capability to remotely switch between autonomous feedback control and manual radio control. Ideally, I would like the manual controls to continue to work in the case that the feedback controller (MCU) stops working. And let's say I have an 8 channel radio reciever with 8 individual PWM outputs.</p>
      <p>The task of switching between manual and autonomous control for N actuators is easily accomplished with N 2 input multiplexers. This is no big deal. Controlling the multiplexers on the other hand requires some work. If we are to use one of the RC channels to do the task, we need to be able to assign two distinct digital values to two different pulse widths, or ranges of widths in some way. In other words, we need a circuit which effectively compares the pulse width from a reciever channel with a reference, and output either a high or low signal accordingly. </p>
      <h2>Time Measurement: The Integrator</h2>
      <p>From what I gather from googling, most multichannel RC systems use a ppm signal with delays ranging from 1 to 2ms, with a frame period of approximately 20ms. Some sources claim 22.5ms, some 27ms... but the 1 to 2 ms range for pulse separation (or pulse width once decoded as separate pwm channels) seems to be very standard. For the purpose of solving our problem, we simply need to be able to detect the difference between a long and a short pulse.</p>
      <p>An easy analog way to infer the duration of a pulse is to use an integrator: starting with a zero output, just apply a constant input for the duration of the pulse, and a zero input otherwise. Once the pulse has passed, measure the voltage at the output and congratulations: given that you know the values of your resistor and your capacitor, and the input voltage, you now know how much time has elapsed. We could make a very accurate pulse width to analog voltage converter using a resettable integrator and a sample and hold circuit, and then apply that signal to a simple voltage comparator, but two things: (1) we don't have to do that, and (2) we don't want to do that. There is an easier way.</p>
      <h2>Modification of a Common Circuit</h2>
      <p>Probably everyone has seen the following circuit in the <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm124-n.pdf" target = "_blank">LM324 datasheet</a></p>
      <img class="displayed" src="images/lm324VCO.PNG" />
      <p>It turns out, this will do exactly what we need if we (1) remove the feedback, and instead apply the pulse to the base of the bjt and (2) change a couple resistor values and the capacitor value. The circuit we are interested in looks like this:</p>
      <img class="displayed" src="images/pwCOMP_schem_general.PNG" />
			<p>Since the bjt is operating as a switch, the integrator section takes two distinct configurations: one when the switch is open (pulse signal low) and another when the switch is closed (pulse signal high).</p>

			<p>The voltage labled Vth is the thevenin equivalent voltage of the formed by the R1/R2 resistor divider across the source voltage: Vth = R2/(R1+R2)Vdd. </p>
