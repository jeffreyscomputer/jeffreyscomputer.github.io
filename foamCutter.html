      <h1>Hot Wire Foam Cutter</h1>
      <p>One of the projects I worked on with <a href="http://mariahcsepanyi.com" target="_blank">
     	Mariah</a> required the fabrication of about a thousand cubic feet worth of various polystyrene forms. Some were simple geometric shapes and others were not.</p>
			<img class="displayed" src="images/foam-foot-rough.jpg" />
      <p>Some of the simpler designs were presented to industrial foam fabricators, but the quoted costs were too much to justify. So I had to cut it all. Now, the nicest way to cut polystyrene foam is with a hot wire (my opinion), so a small part of the job was making a variable current hot wire cutter. Here is the system I ended up with:</p>
      <img class="displayed" src="images/foamcutter-full.JPG" />
      <p>This is a really simple solution. It operates with a 12-50VDC power supply, and the only control is a single turn pot which varies the PWM duty applied to a low side switch. The cutting element is a length of 26AWG nicrome heater wire, which is connected to the controller via some low voltage outdoor lighting cable. The guage of the cutting element is a trade off - heavier wire is stronger, but lighter wire takes less current to get hot. 26AWG nicrome wire has a resistance per length of a little better than 2.6 ohms/foot, and it takes about 2A to get to foam cutting temperature (somewhere between 400F - 600F). I needed a cutter length of at least 4.5' which means a minimum resistance of about 12 ohms. That sets the minimum power supply voltage required at 24V. Now, I figured there could be a little loss in the connecting cables, and there could considerable loss in the switch since I didn't want to make a proper FET driver, so I figure just double it. Here is a little close up of the controller:</p>
      <img class="displayed" src="images/foamcutter-controller.JPG" />
      <p>The circuit is just a variable duty astable 555 timer configuration, powered from a simple zener shunt regulator, and directly driving the gate of an IRF540 N-channel hexFET. This is not really the best way to drive this switch, but it was adequate for what I had to do. If I had to do it again I would spice the FET driver up a bit.</p>
      <p>Here is a closeup of the wire clamps on the handles--the configuration used for manual cuts:</p>
      <img class="displayed" src="images/foamcutter-handles.JPG" />
      <p>There were a bunch of other configurations too. Since I was going to be cutting from 4' X 3' X 8' blocks, I decided to make up a system with a cart on a track so I could just set the cutter and push the foam through it. Here is a picture of that setup -- the cutter isn't shown, but you can imagine the wire stretched between the posts to the sides of the foam block:</p>

			<p>Most of the pieces I was cutting had a slight slope to them, so I gave the cart a 2D adjustable tilt:</p>

			<p>The cart was made to roll on a 14' ladder my grandpa had. I did the wheels like this:</p>

			<p>This was great. I also used this in "scroll saw mode" for trimming and curved cuts:</p>

			<p>Like I mentioned before, I got through close to 1000 cubic feet of this stuff. Most of this made up an approximately 1000 sq. ft. sloping landscape with a lazy river -- no joke. The rest went in to the giant foot, and a 12 foot tall temple facade thing. This partial installation will give an idea of how big all this was:</p>

			<p>Once the landscape was all in place, the pieces were taped together in preparation of the next phase:</p>

			<p>After this, a huge EDPM pool liner went in, around 350 gallons of water, 1.7 tons of gravel and some other odds and ends. The final product was a functionin lazy river water ride -- check it out on <a href="http://mariahcsepanyi.com/ALWAYS-BIGGER" target="_blank">
