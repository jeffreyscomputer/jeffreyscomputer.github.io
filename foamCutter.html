      <h1>Hot Wire Foam Cutter</h1>
      <p>One of the projects I worked on with <a href="http://mariahcsepanyi.com" target="_blank">
     	Mariah</a> required the fabrication of about a thousand cubic feet worth of various polystyrene forms. Some were simple geometric shapes and others were not.</p>

      <p>Some of the simpler designs were presented to industrial foam fabricators, but the quoted costs were too much to justify. So I had to cut it all. Now, the nicest way to cut polystyrene foam is with a hot wire (my opinion), so a small part of the job was making a variable current hot wire cutter. Here is the system I ended up with:</p>
      <img class="displayed" src="images/foamcutter-full.JPG" />
      <p>This is a really simple solution. It operates with a 12-50VDC power supply, and the only control is a single turn pot which varies the PWM duty applied to a low side switch. The cutting element is a length of 26AWG nicrome heater wire, which is connected to the controller via some low voltage outdoor lighting cable. The guage of the cutting element is a trade off - heavier wire is stronger, but lighter wire takes less current to get hot. 26AWG nicrome wire has a resistance per length of a little better than 2.6 ohms/foot, and it takes about 2A to get to foam cutting temperature (somewhere between 400F - 600F). I needed a cutter length of at least 4.5' which means a minimum resistance of about 12 ohms. That sets the minimum power supply voltage required at 24V. Now, I figured there could be a little loss in the connecting cables, and there could considerable loss in the switch since I didn't want to make a proper FET driver, so I figure just double it. Here is a little close up of the controller:</p>

      <p>The circuit is just a variable duty astable 555 timer configuration, powered from a simple zener shunt regulator, and directly driving the gate of an IRF540 N-channel hexFET. This is not really the best way to drive this switch, but it was adequate for what I had to do. If I had to do it again I would spice the FET driver up a bit.</p>
      <p>Here is a closeup of the wire clamps on the handles:</p>

      <p>This setup works very well -- cutting effortlessly through 4' wide polystyrene blocks. I will add some more content to this page, but in the meantime, check out the final product and see if you can spot <a href="http://mariahcsepanyi.com/ALWAYS-BIGGER" target="_blank">
